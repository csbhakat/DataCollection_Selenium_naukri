Why are we using selenium ? — Primarily ,Selenium is a test automation tool but we can also use this as a web data scarping tool . Selenium is very help full to collect data from dynamic pages . On the other hand, data scraping tool like beautiful soup can not scrape data from dynamic pages .. Beautiful soup is primarily used for collecting static content from web pages . Based on my analysis , almost all web portals are now using dynamic content in one or another way . Therefore , its good to go with selenium .
